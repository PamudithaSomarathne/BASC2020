1. Raykha cannot touch the base pannel. It has some components on the top surace
2. How do we get Pololu casters?
3. We have very little access to the bottom floor, should make top and bottom parts easily removable
	Some small locks and a single or two large JST between them will be good. Otherwise it'll be hard
	to put back after removing
4. Batteries might have to be charged regularly
5. Need access to all the switches easily
6. Upper color sensor will have to be moved back. The arm cannot get the box to that place
	Consider the 90-degree rotation of the arm
7. We currently have only 4 TOFs, drawing includes 5
8. Some space will be needed to put the arm mechanism
9. We'll need a voltage regulator for motors
