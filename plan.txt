As we cannot make the robot till the uni starts, we shall gather more information about the task and solutions.
We shall find more details about sensors, encoded motors, gyro, color sensors and other stuff, so that we can come up
with better solutions for the task. Following are some of the areas thst I think we should focus on.
	+ A power regulator circuit which can supply 12V and 5V from 7.4V (a new circuit* or modules)
	+ A custom made library for encoders as the built-in library didn't compile correctly last time
	+ A mechanism to lift the box
	+ Decide the things which we put on the bottom level
	+ I2C communication - for TOF sensors and connecting arduinos
	+ A plan of pin usage of Arduino MEGA
	+ Do we need two arduinos?
	+
	+

Please add any other thing you see as important.
We shall keep the idea generation deadline to two-days before uni starts, as we cannot do anything else.
Go through the internet and see what people do so we can use them to come-up with a new idea.
