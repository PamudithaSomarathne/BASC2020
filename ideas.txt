Line follow:
	03/01Yas : Use Raykha and two additional IR sensors
	03/16Pamu: Same old line follow, developed with PID

Curve wall following:
	03/01Yas : Use two ultrasonic sensors close to the front
	03/01Thie: 2 TOF sensors on each side
	03/16Pamu: Curved walls need more than ine sensor to sense each wall

Circle:
	03/19Pamu: Use 7Segment display with its IC for quadrant indication

Box color sensing:
	03/01Yas : Use ultrasonic sensors to detect the box

Dashed line follow:
	With encoders and raykha - everyone	

Ramp:
	03/01Yas : Wheels should be close to the front and rear. Size is critical for turning on the ramp
	03/01Thie: Use two TOF sensors in front to detect the ramp
	03/16Pamu: Gyro sensor to detect the orientation of the robot

Column sensing:
	03/01Yas : Same ultrasonic sensors used to detect walls

Gates:
	03/01Yas : Use front ultrasonic sensor to sense the gate. Move to cross the gate using encoders
	03/01Thie: Use front TOF sensor to find pattern of gates and move.
	03/16Pamu: There's a 13 second gap to pass the gate, easy if timed correctly
