Line follow:
	03/16Pamu: Same old line follow, developed with PID

Curve wall following:
	03/16Pamu: Curved walls need more than ine sensor to sense each wall

Circle:


Box color sensing:


Dashed line follow:
	

Ramp:
	03/16Pamu: Gyro sensor to detect the orientation of the robot

Column sensing:


Gates:
	03/16Pamu: There's a 13 second gap to pass the gate, easy if timed correctly
